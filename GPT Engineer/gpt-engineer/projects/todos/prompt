Develop a ToDo web application utilizing the javascript, ensuring dynamic component-based rendering. The interface should incorporate a CSS Flexbox or Grid system, ensuring fluid responsiveness across a variety of devices, from desktop to mobile. For tasks, employ DOM manipulation techniques to render each with a contrasting `#FFFFFF` background and `#000000` text. Design interactive buttons employing CSS gradients, transitioning colors from deep purple (`#6A1B9A`) to cyan (`#00BCD4`), with hover logic inverting the gradient direction. Utilize CSS transitions or the Web Animations API for a fade-in effect upon task appearance and a slide-out effect for task deletions. Integrate CRUD operations to allow users to modify task content, toggle priority stars, and set date intervals using a date-picker component. Ensure robust error handling and optimize application performance using techniques like lazy loading and code-splitting.
