The code includes the necessary classes and functions to manage tasks, render them on the UI, and handle user interactions. The application uses DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically render tasks and update their properties.\n\nThe entry point of the application is the `index.html` file, which includes the necessary HTML structure and imports the `styles.css` file for custom styling. The JavaScript code is written in the `app.js` file, which creates instances of the `TaskManager` and `UI` classes to manage tasks and handle UI interactions.\n\nPlease note that the CSS styles and error handling logic are not implemented in this code. You can add your own CSS styles to the `styles.css` file and implement error handling based on your specific requirements.\n\nTo run the application, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
